## 🚀 What It Does

Turvax takes the input from a user-facing form — such as:

- 🏡 Property type (apartment, detached house, etc.)
- 📍 Location
- 💰 Budget
- 🔐 Desired services (alarms, surveillance, monitoring, etc.)

...and runs it through a custom scoring algorithm that compares it against a database of providers. The result is a ranked list of the best-matched home security services for the user.

## 💡 Why It Exists

Finding the right security provider is confusing and time-consuming. Turvax automates that decision with an algorithm that understands user needs and maps them to available options — instantly.
This is a tool that was built as a prototype to provide security companies a tool which can be utilised for sales and overall lead generation. After completing the MVP for this,
security companies are approached to add to the pool of companies and the tool is marketed to consumers looking for security services online.
